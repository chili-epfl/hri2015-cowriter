We agree with each of the above points and address the reviewers' remarks below.

We did not intend to claim such a contribution, but we can understand how the misunderstanding can arise from the second-last paragraph and the missing related robotics work. Both will be modified.

We concur.

We agree, and will remedy this in the revision. We will cover the work of others at the intersection of robotics and learning by teaching, and highlight the relevance of our work in the unexplored area of tasks with a physical component.

We will address these points in the sections below.

This was an oversight on our side and we apologise for letting it go undetected.

We agree that this was a wording issue on our part and will make reference to the classification methods used in previous work to determine such categories.

We agree with the points raised: it is a limitation of the question, which we imposed ourselves to avoid putting words in the children's mouths if we were to ask directly if the robot's writing was believable. Our argument is that at no point in the interaction did any child express that they did not believe that the robot was writing itself, even in a situation where they could have said "well, it's not *really* writing". We accept that we cannot conclude that the children believed it was writing, and will reword the outcome to instead be that no child ever expressed that they did not believe it was writing.

All points have been well taken; we appreciate the examples provided.

We can clarify that we indeed refer to a shape centre of 0, not trajectory average.

The title was meant to re-purpose the idiom in the context of children with handwriting difficulties having an opportunity to improve through teaching. We appreciate this reviewer bringing to light the potential for this to strike a nerve with teachers and will accept their recommendation.

We are able to improve the writing style and, as the reviewer noted, the intention was to present new 'enabling technologies'

This is accurate and will be clarified in the section on the shape modeling algorithm.

We have provided also the number of demonstrations for each group, and have refrained from reading further into the data because a full study with large sample sizes has not been completed. The work presented was intended for verification of the technical soundness of the system with children, in line with the theme.

It will be more clearly stated that the results presented were from the 7-8yr age group, not those in the pilot study.
